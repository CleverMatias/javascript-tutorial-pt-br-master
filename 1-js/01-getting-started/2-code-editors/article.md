# Editores de Código

Um editor de code

Um editor de código é o lugar onde os programadores passam a maior parte do tempo.

Existem dois arquétipos: IDE e editores leves. Muitas pessoas se sentem à vontade para escolher uma ferramenta de cada tipo.

## IDE

O termo [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Integrated Development Environment), ou Ambiente de desenvolvimento integrado, significa um editor poderoso com muitos recursos que geralmente opera em um "projeto inteiro". Como o nome sugere, não é apenas um editor, mas um "ambiente de desenvolvimento" em grande escala.

An IDE loads the project (can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), integrates with a version management system (como [git](https://git-scm.com/)), um ambiente de teste e outras coisas de "nível de projeto".

If you haven't considered selecting an IDE yet, look at the following variants:

- [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for frontend development and other editors of the same company if you need additional languages.
- Visual Studio is fine if you're a .NET developer, and a free version is available ([Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/))
- [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org/).

All of the IDEs except Visual Studio are available on Windows, MacOs and Linux. Visual Studio doesn't work on Linux.

Most IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer's salary, so just choose the best one for you.

## Lightweight editors

"Lightweight editors" are not as powerful as IDEs, but they're fast, elegant and simple.

They are mainly used to instantly open and edit a file.

The main difference between a "lightweight editor" and an "IDE" is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.

In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there's no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.

The following options deserve your attention:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (cross-platform, free).
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) (cross-platform, shareware).
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows, free).
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool, if you know how to use them.

## My favorites

The personal preference of the author is to have both an IDE for projects and a lightweight editor for quick and easy file editing.

I'm using:

- [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for JS, and if there is one more language in the project, then I switch to one of the other Jetbrains offerings listed above.
- As a lightweight editor -- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

## Let's not argue

The editors in the lists above are those that either I or my friends who I consider good developers have been using for a long time and are happy with.

There are other great editors in our big world. Please choose the one you like the most.

The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, personal preferences.
